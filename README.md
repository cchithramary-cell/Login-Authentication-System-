# Login Authentication System

This project is a simple **Login Authentication System** that allows users to register and log in securely.

## 🔹 Features
- User Registration (Sign Up)
- User Login (Sign In)
- Password Protection
- Validation for correct credentials

## 🔹 Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS (Frontend)
- JavaScript / Python / Java / PHP (based on your implementation)
- Database (MySQL / SQLite / etc.)

## 🔹 How It Works
1. A new user can **sign up** by entering username and password.
2. Existing users can **log in** with valid credentials.
3. The system validates the entered details.
4. If correct → access granted ✅  
   If wrong → error message ❌  

## 🔹 Future Enhancements
- Add OTP verification
- Password reset option
- Use JWT / OAuth for stronger authentication
